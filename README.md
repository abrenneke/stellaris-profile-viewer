The Stellaris Profile Viewer is a tool that helps you analyze the performance of your Stellaris mods by visualizing the script profiling log file generated by the game's script profiler. This log file contains information about the execution time of various scripts and can help pinpoint which mod or script is causing lag or performance issues. The tool generates a breakdown of your code's performance, including detailed statistics on execution time, parent-child relationships, and more.

## Implementation

The Stellaris Profile Viewer is built entirely in vanilla JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks. The JS is split into three main files:

- `index.js` - This is the entry point of the app and handles all user input, including file selection, parsing, and rendering.
- `parser.js` - This file contains all the logic for parsing the script profiling log file generated by the game's script profiler. It extracts and transforms the relevant data into a tree structure that is easier to work with.
- `rendering.js` - This file contains all the logic for rendering the parsed profile into an interactive table. It uses DOM manipulation to create and update rows as the user interacts with the table.
- `worker.js` - Web worker that handles the actual parsing of the log file in a separate thread. Improves the responsiveness of the UI while the log file is being processed.

## Code Quality

Questionable. It's AI generated after all.
